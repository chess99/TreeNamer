# Implementation Status

This document provides an overview of the current implementation status of the TreeNamer application and outlines the next steps for development.

## Current Implementation Status

### Backend Features (Rust)

#### Directory Tree Parsing (`tree.rs`)

- ✅ Reading and traversing directory structure
- ✅ Formatting directory tree as text
- ✅ Filtering (exclude patterns, max depth)
- ✅ Options for handling symlinks and hidden files

#### File System Operations (`fs.rs`)

- ✅ Basic file operations (create, delete, rename)
- ✅ Tree text parsing
- ✅ Operation generation from tree differences
- ⚠️ Rename operation handling (needs improvement)
- ✅ Protected path detection

### Frontend Features (React)

#### Directory Tree UI

- ✅ Text-based tree view
- ✅ Tree visualization with expandable nodes
- ✅ Split view with original and modified trees
- ✅ Diff view to visualize changes

#### Editing Features

- ✅ Monaco editor integration for text-based editing
- ✅ Real-time preview of changes
- ✅ Operations preview (showing what will be changed)

#### User Interface

- ✅ Main application layout
- ✅ Directory settings modal
- ✅ Confirmation dialog for applying changes
- ✅ Notifications for feedback

#### State Management

- ✅ Directory path management
- ✅ Tree loading with options
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading state management
- ✅ Change application

## Recent Improvements

1. **Complete Frontend Integration**
   - Added operations preview to show what changes will be applied
   - Improved feedback with notifications system
   - Enhanced UI with loading indicators and disabled states

2. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Added real-time change preview
   - Improved error handling and feedback
   - Enhanced dark mode support

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Optimized change detection algorithm

## Next Steps

### Short-term Priorities

1. **Improve Rename Operation Handling**
   - Implement explicit tracking of filesystem entities
   - Maintain entity identity through unique identifiers
   - Update data structure to track original and current paths
   - Ensure proper propagation of renames to child entities

2. **Testing and Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive testing on different platforms
   - More robust error handling for edge cases
   - Graceful recovery from failures

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize handling of large directory structures
   - Improve parsing and diff algorithms

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Graph-based visualization of directory structure
   - Visual diff with drag-and-drop capabilities
   - Context menu for common operations

2. **Batch Operations**
   - Support for batch renaming with patterns
   - Operation history

## Development Roadmap

1. **v0.2.0** - Current implementation with complete workflow
2. **v0.3.0** - Improved rename algorithm and error handling
3. **v0.4.0** - Performance optimizations and enhanced visualization
4. **v0.5.0** - Batch operations and extended features
5. **v1.0.0** - Stable release with user preferences and refinements
