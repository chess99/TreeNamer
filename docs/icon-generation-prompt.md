2. Abstract folder tree icon, minimal geometric design, single clean blue trunk with 3 green circular nodes, one small text cursor, solid white background, high contrast, flat design, easily recognizable at small sizes, developer tool style, 32k, --ar 1:1 --v 5.2

3. Minimalist tree diagram with simplified trunk and only 3 branch lines, one small edit symbol, flat design with professional blue-green color palette, solid white background, clean geometric shapes, easily scalable, modern tech aesthetic, 32k, --ar 1:1 --v 5.2

## Key Design Principles

Based on icon design best practices, this icon follows these principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Using only essential elements (tree structure + text cursor) with no decorative or unnecessary details
2. **Clear metaphor**: Representing the app's core functionality through a universally recognized metaphor (tree structure for directory visualization)
3. **Scalability**: Simple geometric shapes that remain recognizable at small sizes (16x16px)
4. **Distinctive silhouette**: Creating a unique outline that's identifiable even when small
5. **Limited color palette**: Using only 2-3 colors (blue, green, white) for professional appearance
6. **Single focal point**: Centering the design around one clear concept (the tree structure)
7. **Flat design**: Avoiding 3D effects, shadows, or complex gradients that don't scale well
8. **High contrast**: Ensuring the icon stands out against backgrounds

## Application Overview

TreeNamer is a desktop utility application that helps users visualize directory trees and perform batch renaming operations through an intuitive text-based interface. The application allows users to see their file structure as a tree, edit it by simply modifying text, and then have the changes applied to the actual file system.

## Core Concepts to Represent

1. **Tree Structure**: The primary visual metaphor is a directory tree, showing hierarchical relationships
2. **Transformation/Renaming**: The concept of changing or renaming elements within the tree
3. **Text-Based Editing**: Representing the unique approach of editing through text rather than traditional drag-and-drop

## Icon Design Requirements

### Style Guidelines

- **Modern and Clean**: Simple, recognizable shapes with a minimalist approach
- **Professional**: Suitable for developers, data analysts, and other professional users
- **Distinctive**: Should be recognizable at small sizes (16x16, 32x32 pixels)
- **Cross-Platform Look**: Should look appropriate on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Key Visual Elements

Consider incorporating these visual elements:

- A stylized tree structure (directory tree)
- A text/code element to represent the text-based editing
- A transformation indicator (arrows, change symbol)
- The letters "TN" could be subtly integrated

### Color Palette Suggestions

Primary colors:

- Deep blue (#1A365D) - Representing stability and professionalism
- Vibrant green (#38A169) - Representing trees/file systems
- Light gray (#E2E8F0) - For subtle details

Accent colors:

- Teal (#319795) - For highlighting transformative actions
- Gold (#D69E2E) - For emphasizing key interactive elements

### Icon Variations Needed

1. **Application Icon** (256x256, 128x128, 64x64, 32x32, 16x16)
   - Should be recognizable at all sizes
   - Will be displayed in system trays, docks, and file explorer

2. **Document Icon** (optional)
   - For files associated with TreeNamer
   - Should have a family resemblance to the main app icon

## Examples for Inspiration

- VS Code's icon combines code brackets with a simple, recognizable shape
- GitHub Desktop's icon uses a simple silhouette with meaningful negative space
- Finder/Explorer icons use simple folder metaphors with distinctive elements

## Technical Specifications

- Vector-based design (SVG) with exports to PNG and ICO formats
- Transparent background
- Should remain recognizable when displayed as a monochrome icon
- Must be provided in formats compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Brand Personality

TreeNamer should be perceived as:

- Professional
- Efficient
- Trustworthy
- Modern
- Developer-friendly

The icon should convey these qualities while remaining simple and recognizable.
